# GeoCell

The GeoCell repository was built to visualize a large dataset of spatial, multiplexed data at a single-cell resolution.

The streamlit_app.py and streamlit_app_lindo.py files contain the initial and final versions of our streamlit app, respectively.

The process_book.Rmd and process_book.html files contain a write up of the creative process behind our visualization.

The final visualization is available at https://geocellclone.streamlit.app/
